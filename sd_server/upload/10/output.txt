This is PTP - a Poisson tree processes model for species delimitation.
Version 1.1 released by Jiajie Zhang on 17-05-2013

This program will delimit species on a rooted phylogenetic tree.
The input tree should be in Newick format (such as the output from RAxML).
PTP can also infer phylogenetic tree using RAxML, currently only support DNA on GTRGAMMA.
The program needs ETE(http://ete.cgenomics.org/) package to be installed.
