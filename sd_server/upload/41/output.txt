This is pGMYC - a python implementation of GMYC model for species delimitation.
Version 1.1 released by Jiajie Zhang on 10-11-2013

This program will delimit species on a rooted ultrametric tree, 
using single threshold GMYC model.
The input tree should be in Newick format and must be ultrametric.
Some common programs to infer ultrametric tree are: BEAST, DPPDIV and r8s.
pGMYC needs scipy and matplotlib packages to be installed.

**This new version experimentally support multifurcating tree, which 
**is quite common for many ultrametric tree inference programs.
**Note: pGMYC does not check the ultrametricity of the input tree!
